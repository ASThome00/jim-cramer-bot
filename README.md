WE LIKE THE STOCK(S)
<hr/>

The Jim Cramer bot is a half-joke half-serious stock market trading application. The main difference in this application compared to something like Robinhood or WeBull is this program trades primarily using algorithms instead of manual orders.

There are multiple benefits to this approach to the stock market over traditional manual ordering, including:
- Algorithmic trading can submit orders hundreds of times quicker than manual trading
- Day trading is much more predictable than traditional trading since an algorthm views rapidly changing market data in real time
- Pattern recognition software could allow for a self-learning algorithm to programatically get better at trading over time
